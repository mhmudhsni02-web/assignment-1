//------------------------------------------------------------------//

//1. What is the difference between forEach and for...of? When would you use each?

//--forEach() : build in function in java script used to apllay operations in array for each element 
// with out changing the values ,returns void 

//--for...of : java script loop works on all nonpremitive and primitv data type like
//  (array, objects, string) called iterables 
//---------------------------------//

//2. What is hoisting and what is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)? Explain with examples.
// hoisting : is a stage when running the code line by line when the varibles been decleard
// they hoisted at the top of the code in the memory , and assign the values to them
// in the excution context box 
let x = 10 
console.log(x)

//here the Interpreter reads the code line by line 
//it found the varible x 
//it Reserve a blace for it in the memory [hoisted]
//and after that assign the value and print it 

//TDZ : The time between when a variable is hoisted and when 
// it is initialized it only applies to let and const

//------------------------------------//

//3. What are the main differences between == and ===?
// == compair between the values only
// === compair between values and types

//------------------------------------//

//4. Explain how try-catch works and why it is important in async operations. ???????????

//5. What’s the difference between type conversion and coercion? Provide examples of each.

//conversion : convert the types into anoter types
Number('123')
String(123)

// coercion : automatic javascript operation convert type another type
console.log(1 == '1')
